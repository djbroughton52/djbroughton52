      <h2>About the Wednesday Club</h2>
      <p class="indented space-after">Every family has traditions...</p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         What started as a simple weekly shopping trip quietly became a
         wonderful routine — then habit — then something none of us wanted to
         miss.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
         It involves a Wednesday visit to the supermarket and is usually
         followed by a meal together... Pizza Hut being our favourite.
      </p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         The routine is simple: meet up, wander the aisles and then eat together
         and enjoy each-other’s company.
      </p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         Somewhere between the shopping trolley, the check out ladies who have
         got to know us, and the meals together, the conversations and wonderful
         time with the children just happens — these are the special times that
         you don’t plan and can’t schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         The children / grandchildren / niece and nephew grow, and new memories
         quietly appear.
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
         <strong>Official purpose:</strong> Spending time together.<br />
         Attendance is encouraged but never compulsory.
      </p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         Membership passes automatically from one generation to the next.
      </p>
      <p class="indented"><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
      <p class="indented">Be family</p>
      <p class="indented">Show up on Wednesdays (when possible)</p>
      <p class="indented space-after">Shop, eat, talk, hug, laugh, repeat</p>
      <p class="indented space-after">
         This website keeps some of those special moments in one place: photos,
         plans, and proof that ordinary Wednesdays are never really ordinary!
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
         The children will grow, the stories will change, and the meals will
         vary — but Wednesdays remain ours xxx
