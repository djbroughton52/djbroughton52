**About the Wednesday Club**

Every family has traditions....

What started as a simple weekly shopping trip quietly became a wonderful routine — then habit — then something none of us wanted to miss.

It involves a Wednesday visit to the supermarket and is usually followed by a meal together...Pizza Hut being our favourite.

The routine is simple: meet up, wander the aisles and then eat together and enjoy each-other’s company.

Somewhere between the shopping trolley, the check out ladies who have got to know us, and the meals together, the conversations and wonderful time with the children just happens — these are the special times that you don’t plan and can’t schedule.

The children / grandchildren / niece and nephew grow, and new memories quietly appear.

Official purpose: Spending time together.
Attendance is encouraged but never compulsory.

Membership passes automatically from one generation to the next.

Requirements:
1. Be family
2. Show up on Wednesdays (when possible)
3. Shop, Eat, talk, hug, laugh, repeat

This website keeps some of those special moments in one place: photos, plans, and proof that ordinary Wednesdays are never really ordinary.

The children will grow, the stories will change, and the meals will vary — but Wednesdays remain ours xxx
